### Basic Usage

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
    "github.com/benharold/libdrag/pkg/api"
)

func main() {
    // Create and initialize the libdrag API
    libdragAPI := api.NewLibDragAPI()
    
    if err := libdragAPI.Initialize(); err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    
    // Start multiple races
    raceID1, err := libdragAPI.StartRaceWithID()
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    
    raceID2, err := libdragAPI.StartRaceWithID()
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    
    // Monitor races independently
    for !libdragAPI.IsRaceCompleteByID(raceID1) || !libdragAPI.IsRaceCompleteByID(raceID2) {
        time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)
        
        // Get status for each race
        fmt.Println("Race 1 Status:", libdragAPI.GetRaceStatusJSONByID(raceID1))
        fmt.Println("Race 2 Status:", libdragAPI.GetRaceStatusJSONByID(raceID2))

## Architecture

The library is structured with clear separation of concerns:

- **pkg/api**: Public API interface with support for concurrent races
- **pkg/orchestrator**: Race orchestration and coordination
- **pkg/timing**: High-precision timing system
- **pkg/tree**: Christmas tree light sequence
- **pkg/component**: Component system architecture
- **pkg/config**: Configuration management
- **pkg/events**: Event bus system for component communication
- **internal/vehicle**: Vehicle simulation (internal implementation)

## Racing Formats Supported

- NHRA Pro Tree (0.4 second intervals)
- NHRA Sportsman Tree (0.5 second intervals)
- IHRA formats
- Custom timing configurations

## Concurrent Racing

The library supports multiple simultaneous races with these features:

- **Race IDs**: Each race gets a unique UUID for tracking
- **Configurable Limits**: Set maximum concurrent races (default: 10)
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Races are automatically cleaned up when complete
- **Resource Management**: Efficient memory usage with proper cleanup
- **Timeout Protection**: Races automatically timeout after 30 seconds

## Compliance Status

### ‚úÖ Currently Implemented (NHRA/IHRA Compliant)
- Three-light rule auto-start activation (NHRA 4.4.1, IHRA 3.2.2)
- Pro Tree (0.4s) and Sportsman Tree (0.5s) sequences
- Basic staging timeouts (7s Professional, 10s Sportsman)
- Random delay generation (0.6-1.1s Pro, 0.6-1.4s Sportsman)
- Guard beam violation detection
- Emergency stop protocols

### ‚ùå Not Yet Implemented (Critical for Full Compliance)
- **Deep staging restrictions enforcement** (Super Gas/Stock/Street classes)
- **Centerline violation detection** (Required for professional events)
- **Complete class configurations** (missing 10+ NHRA/IHRA classes)
- **Enhanced safety systems** (boundary beams, backup timing)
- **Race director override capabilities**
- **Anti-cheating systems** (delay box detection)

See [docs/nhra-ihra-compliance.md](docs/nhra-ihra-compliance.md) for detailed compliance status.

## Use Cases
