Based on my research, I can now provide you with comprehensive information about deep staging rules and the CompuLink system terminology:

## Deep Staging Rules by Class

**Classes Where Deep Staging is Prohibited:**
The rule set came from 'back in the day' when the Super Gas Class was created and it has to this day remained a rule for 3 classes: Super Gas/Super Stock/Super Street. Research shows that the rule was arbitrarily decided on by the racers and second that the rule was originally created to save time on the starting line. This was before the advent of Autostart.

**Classes Where Deep Staging is Allowed:**
Most other classes allow deep staging, but the implementation varies significantly depending on track policy and AutoStart system settings.

## Deep Staging and AutoStart System Interaction

The relationship between deep staging and AutoStart depends on three different scenarios:

**1. Deep Staging with AutoStart Armed:**
We will still allow deep staging; however will no longer hold the tree for a deep staging driver. This means if a driver wishes to stage deep, he/she must get in and stage first. In this scenario, drivers must complete their deep staging within the standard timeout period.

**2. Deep Staging with AutoStart "Honored":**
If it is, it means they will not flip the switch to turn on AutoStart (ie start the race) until you are fully in to deep stage. This requires drivers to indicate their intention to deep stage, often by writing "DEEP" on your window in shoe polish.

**3. Deep Staging with AutoStart Disabled:**
When AutoStart is completely disabled, the starter has full discretion and can allow both drivers as much time as needed to get positioned properly.

## "Armed" vs "Activated" Terminology

Based on the search results, these terms describe different states of the AutoStart system:

**"Armed":**
If track clear & switch is armed as both approach pre-stage, takes both to start, and can sit there both pre-staged all day (at least until the starter directs you both in), nothing happens...but once one stages, or both, those variables get closer. "Armed" refers to the AutoStart system being turned on and ready to function, but not yet actively counting down.

**"Activated":**
Once one stages, or both, those variables get closer, tree is activated, then lots of tiny variables take over. "Activated" refers to the system actually beginning the countdown timer once the required staging conditions are met.

## Technical Sequence:

1. **Armed State:** AutoStart is turned on by the starter, system is ready but waiting
2. **Activation Trigger:** System detects the required staging pattern (typically three lights: two pre-stage bulbs and one stage bulb)
3. **Activated State:** Countdown timer begins, and the system will automatically start the tree or time out non-staged drivers

The starter controls when the system is "armed" (turned on), but the system automatically becomes "activated" based on the drivers' staging behavior once the proper conditions are met.
