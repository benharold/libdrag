Perfect! Now I have detailed information about the CompuLink timeout system. Let me provide a comprehensive answer based on the search results.

The CompuLink AutoStart timeout system is a sophisticated feature designed to prevent staging battles and ensure fair competition. Here are the specific details:

**Basic Operation:**
When the system sees both cars prestaged and ONE of the cars staged, it starts a timer. If the second car does not enter the staging beams within the specified time, a redlight is activated for that car. The system needs to see three lights before it starts the timer - two prestages and a stage.

**Timer Duration:**
The timeout duration varies by event type and track settings:

- **NHRA Professional Series:** Seven seconds in NHRA Lucas Oil Drag Racing Series and NHRA Camping World Drag Racing Series competition
- **Bracket Events:** The timeout is typically longer at bracket events
- **Track Variations:** Some tracks adjust the clock down to 7 seconds in some places, while others may use 15 seconds or 10 seconds
- **Standard Recommendation:** The suggested value from NHRA and Compulink is 10 seconds

**Advanced Timer Features:**
Some systems have additional timeout mechanisms:
- Some systems also have a 30 second timer that starts when both vehicles are pre-staged
- Once both cars have staged for 0.6 seconds, the Tree will come on between 0.6 and 1.4 seconds later, depending on the class

**Critical Technical Detail:**
Once the three lights (pre-stage for both lanes as well as stage in the other) on the Tree have been lit for .6 seconds continuously, the timeout process begins. This means the system requires a stable 0.6-second period with all three lights illuminated before the countdown starts.

**System Manipulation:**
The search results reveal that some racers have learned to manipulate this system: Said racer will inch into the stage beams ever so gently and light their stage bulb briefly before turning it back out. This creates a situation where both lanes are on the clock while neither driver is actually fully staged.

**Non-Negotiable Nature:**
This redlight will NOT be negotiated! - the system automatically disqualifies the driver who fails to stage within the timeout period, with no possibility of appeal or re-run.

This system was implemented to eliminate staging battles and ensure consistent, fair starts while removing the human element of starter judgment from the timing process.
