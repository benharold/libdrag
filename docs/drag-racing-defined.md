Burnout

A burnout in drag racing is when a driver spins the rear wheels while keeping
the front wheels stationary. This heats up and cleans the rear tires, making
them sticky and providing better traction for the launch.

Pre-stage

The pre-stage process describes the period of time between the burnout and
the stage sequence. In the context of the librag library, the pre-stage process
does not include any specific timing or light sequences. It is the period
of a race before any beams have been broken, and no specific timing rules apply.

Staging

The staging process is the sequence of events that occurs once a combination of
specific conditions are met. The conditions required to start the staging process
vary by sanctioning body, track, and class. Once the staging process begins,
a sequence of events occurs that eventually leads to the start of the run unless
the process is interrupted by a manual emergency stop performed by the starter.

Start

The start of the race is the moment when the staging process is complete. At
this specific moment, the state of the Christmas Tree is analyzed, and it is
determined whether the required staging conditions have been met. If a driver
has not completed the staging process, that driver is disqualified. If there
are only two participants, the outcome of the race is immediately determined.

At any moment after the start of the race, but before the green light is illuminated
for a particular lane, a driver has the potential to violate the rules of the
starting process. This can result in a red light disqualification.

The instant that all green lights on the Christmas Tree are illuminated marks
the end of the start process and the beginning of the run.

Run

A run is the period of time between the start and finish of a race when
competitors are driving their vehicles down the track, sequentually breaking
the light beams position on the race track. The timing system records the
time elapsed between the moment the staging beam was broken to the moment
that each is broken.

Finish

The finish of a run is when the last beam is broken. If at least two drivers
make it to the finish beam without first being disqualified, the result of
the race is determined when one of the drivers breaks their finish line
beam.
