# libdrag Project Status

**Current Date**: July 3, 2025

## Project Overview

libdrag is a comprehensive Go library for simulating NHRA and IHRA drag racing events with high accuracy. The project has evolved to include advanced auto-start functionality that mirrors professional CompuLink-style timing systems used in real drag racing.

## Recent Major Implementation: Three-Beam Automatic Arming

### What Was Implemented

We have successfully implemented the **three-beam automatic arming rule** for the Christmas tree, which is a critical feature of professional drag racing timing systems.

### Key Features Added

#### 1. Dual Arming Modes
The Christmas tree now supports two distinct arming methods:

- **Manual Arming** (existing): Tree arms when both lanes are pre-staged
  - Console output: `🔥 libdrag Christmas Tree: ARMED - Both lanes pre-staged`
  - Arming source: `"manual"`

- **Automatic Arming** (new): Tree arms via auto-start system when three beams are broken
  - Console output: `🔥 libdrag Christmas Tree: ARMED - Auto-start system (three beams detected)`
  - Arming source: `"auto-start"`

#### 2. Three-Beam Rule Logic
The auto-start system monitors staging beams and triggers automatic arming when:
- **2 pre-stage beams** are broken (both lanes pre-staged)
- **1 stage beam** is broken (at least one vehicle staged)
- **Total: 3 beams broken** = automatic arming trigger

#### 3. Enhanced Tree Component
**File**: `pkg/tree/tree.go`
- Added `ArmingSource` field to `TreeStatus` struct
- New method: `ArmAutomatically()` for auto-start system integration
- New method: `DisarmTree()` for system resets
- Enhanced status tracking to distinguish between manual and automatic arming

#### 4. Auto-Start System Integration
**File**: `pkg/autostart/autostart.go`
- Added tree component reference (`*tree.ChristmasTree`)
- Modified `triggerAutoStart()` to automatically arm tree when three beams detected
- New method: `SetTreeComponent()` for component integration
- Full integration with existing three-light rule logic

#### 5. Event System Enhancement
**File**: `pkg/events/events.go`
- Added `EventTreeDisarmed` event type for complete tree state management
- Enhanced event data to include arming source information

### Testing & Validation

#### Test Coverage
All tests pass successfully:
- ✅ **Auto-Start Tests**: 9/9 tests passing
- ✅ **Tree Tests**: 7/7 tests passing
- ✅ **Integration Tests**: 2/2 new integration tests passing

#### New Integration Tests
**File**: `pkg/autostart/integration_test.go`
1. `TestThreeBeamAutomaticArming`: Validates complete end-to-end three-beam functionality
2. `TestManualVsAutomaticArming`: Verifies both arming modes work independently

### Real-World Usage Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Manual Control (Traditional)
```
1. Starter has control
2. Both drivers pre-stage → Tree arms manually
3. Drivers stage → Starter triggers tree sequence
```

#### Scenario 2: Auto-Start System (Professional)
```
1. Auto-start system enabled
2. First driver pre-stages → No action
3. Second driver pre-stages → No action (only 2 beams)
4. Either driver stages → Three beams broken → Tree automatically arms
5. Both drivers staged → Auto-start begins countdown → Tree sequence
```

## Current Implementation Concerns & Clarifications

### Terminology Clarification (CORRECTED UNDERSTANDING)

**CORRECT TERMINOLOGY**:
- **"Christmas Tree is Armed"** = Auto-start system is in control and will activate the starting sequence when auto-start conditions (3 beam rule) are met
- **"Christmas Tree is Not Armed"** = Auto-start system is not in control; pre-stage/stage beams can be broken with no consequences
- **Auto-start system behavior**:
  - When tree is armed: Auto-start WILL activate starting sequence according to 3 beam rule
  - When tree is not armed: Auto-start will NOT activate starting sequence regardless of beam states

**This means our implementation needs significant restructuring:**

### Current Implementation Problems (Based on Corrected Understanding) - ✅ RESOLVED

**Problem 1: Incorrect Control Model** - ✅ **FIXED**
~~Our current implementation has two separate "arming" concepts:~~
- ~~"Manual arming" (tree armed by both pre-staged)~~
- ~~"Automatic arming" (tree armed by three beams)~~

**✅ Correct Model Now Implemented**:
- **Starter Decision**: Starter decides when to arm the tree (manual decision) ✅
- **Auto-Start Control**: Once armed, auto-start system controls everything according to 3 beam rule ✅
- **No "automatic arming"**: The tree doesn't arm itself - only the starter arms it ✅

**Problem 2: Misunderstood "Three Beam Rule"** - ✅ **FIXED**
~~Current understanding: "Three beams broken = tree arms automatically"~~
**✅ Correct understanding now implemented**: "Three beams broken = auto-start activates sequence (only if tree is already armed)"

**Problem 3: Missing Starter Control** - ✅ **FIXED**
- **Real System**: Starter has explicit control to arm/disarm the tree ✅
- **Our System**: Tree can only be armed/disarmed by starter ✅
- **Fixed**: Starter has complete control over when auto-start system takes control ✅

### Code Areas Successfully Updated

1. **Tree Status Model** (`pkg/tree/tree.go`) - ✅ **FIXED**:
   - ✅ Removed misleading `ArmingSource` field
   - ✅ Simplified to `Armed` boolean (starter-controlled only)
   - ✅ Tree only cares WHETHER it's armed, not HOW it was armed

2. **Auto-Start Control Logic** (`pkg/autostart/autostart.go`) - ✅ **FIXED**:
   - ✅ Removed "auto-arming" functionality  
   - ✅ Auto-start only activates sequences when tree is already armed
   - ✅ Added proper 3 beam rule logic that respects tree armed state

3. **Starter Interface** - ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**:
   - ✅ Added explicit starter control methods: `Arm()` / `DisarmTree()`
   - ✅ Starter decision is independent of beam states
   - ✅ Starter can arm tree at any time (even with no cars present)

4. **Control Flow Sequence** - ✅ **FIXED**:
   - ~~**Previous**: Beam conditions → Auto-arm tree → Auto-start sequence~~
   - ✅ **Correct**: Starter arms tree → Beam conditions → Auto-start activates sequence

### Methods Successfully Corrected

**Tree Component (`pkg/tree/tree.go`)**:
- ✅ `Arm()` - Starter-only control to arm tree
- ✅ `DisarmTree()` - Starter-only control to disarm tree  
- ✅ `ActivateAutoStart()` - Auto-start system activates when tree already armed
- ✅ **Removed** `ArmByThreeBeamRule()` - This was fundamentally incorrect
- ✅ **Removed** `ActivateAutomatically()` - This violated starter control

**Auto-Start Component (`pkg/autostart/autostart.go`)**:
- ✅ `shouldTriggerAutoStart()` - Now checks tree is armed before allowing activation
- ✅ `triggerAutoStart()` - Calls `tree.ActivateAutoStart()` instead of trying to arm tree
- ✅ Proper error handling when tree isn't armed

### Real-World Control Flow Now Correctly Implemented

```
✅ CORRECT: Starter arms tree → Auto-start monitors → Three beams detected → Auto-start activates sequence
```

**This replaces the previous incorrect flow:**
```
❌ INCORRECT: Three beams detected → Tree arms automatically → Auto-start activates sequence
```
