# libdrag Project Status

**Current Date**: July 3, 2025

## Project Overview

libdrag is a comprehensive Go library for simulating NHRA and IHRA drag racing events with high accuracy. The project has evolved to include advanced auto-start functionality that mirrors professional CompuLink-style timing systems used in real drag racing.

## Recent Major Implementation: Three-Beam Automatic Arming

### What Was Implemented

We have successfully implemented the **three-beam automatic arming rule** for the Christmas tree, which is a critical feature of professional drag racing timing systems.

### Key Features Added

#### 1. Dual Arming Modes
The Christmas tree now supports two distinct arming methods:

- **Manual Arming** (existing): Tree arms when both lanes are pre-staged
  - Console output: `ðŸ”¥ libdrag Christmas Tree: ARMED - Both lanes pre-staged`
  - Arming source: `"manual"`

- **Automatic Arming** (new): Tree arms via auto-start system when three beams are broken
  - Console output: `ðŸ”¥ libdrag Christmas Tree: ARMED - Auto-start system (three beams detected)`
  - Arming source: `"auto-start"`

#### 2. Three-Beam Rule Logic
The auto-start system monitors staging beams and triggers automatic arming when:
- **2 pre-stage beams** are broken (both lanes pre-staged)
- **1 stage beam** is broken (at least one vehicle staged)
- **Total: 3 beams broken** = automatic arming trigger

#### 3. Enhanced Tree Component
**File**: `pkg/tree/tree.go`
- Added `ArmingSource` field to `TreeStatus` struct
- New method: `ArmAutomatically()` for auto-start system integration
- New method: `DisarmTree()` for system resets
- Enhanced status tracking to distinguish between manual and automatic arming

#### 4. Auto-Start System Integration
**File**: `pkg/autostart/autostart.go`
- Added tree component reference (`*tree.ChristmasTree`)
- Modified `triggerAutoStart()` to automatically arm tree when three beams detected
- New method: `SetTreeComponent()` for component integration
- Full integration with existing three-light rule logic

#### 5. Event System Enhancement
**File**: `pkg/events/events.go`
- Added `EventTreeDisarmed` event type for complete tree state management
- Enhanced event data to include arming source information

### Testing & Validation

#### Test Coverage
All tests pass successfully:
- âœ… **Auto-Start Tests**: 9/9 tests passing
- âœ… **Tree Tests**: 7/7 tests passing
- âœ… **Integration Tests**: 2/2 new integration tests passing

#### New Integration Tests
**File**: `pkg/autostart/integration_test.go`
1. `TestThreeBeamAutomaticArming`: Validates complete end-to-end three-beam functionality
2. `TestManualVsAutomaticArming`: Verifies both arming modes work independently

### Real-World Usage Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Manual Control (Traditional)
```
1. Starter has control
2. Both drivers pre-stage â†’ Tree arms manually
3. Drivers stage â†’ Starter triggers tree sequence
```

#### Scenario 2: Auto-Start System (Professional)
```
1. Auto-start system enabled
2. First driver pre-stages â†’ No action
3. Second driver pre-stages â†’ No action (only 2 beams)
4. Either driver stages â†’ Three beams broken â†’ Tree automatically arms
5. Both drivers staged â†’ Auto-start begins countdown â†’ Tree sequence
```

## Current Implementation Concerns & Clarifications

### Terminology Issues (Not Yet Addressed)

**Problem 1: Conflicting "Armed" States**
Our current implementation uses confusing terminology:
- We say the "Christmas tree is armed" 
- We also say the "auto-start system is armed"
- This creates ambiguity about which component controls what

**Correct Terminology Should Be**:
- **Christmas Tree**: Should be "armed" when ready to begin a sequence
- **Auto-Start System**: Should be "activated" when the tree is armed, not "armed" itself

**Problem 2: Misunderstood Control Flow**
Current implementation suggests two separate arming modes:
- Manual arming (starter controls everything)
- Automatic arming (auto-start controls everything)

**Real-World Behavior Should Be**:
- Auto-start is **always** used once the tree is armed
- The starter's role is to **choose when to arm the tree**
- Once armed, auto-start system takes over regardless of beam states
- Starter doesn't manually trigger the starting sequence

### Current Implementation vs. Real-World Reality

**What We Implemented**:
```
Scenario 1 (Manual): Starter arms tree â†’ Starter triggers sequence
Scenario 2 (Auto): Three beams â†’ Auto-start arms tree â†’ Auto-start triggers sequence
```

**What Actually Happens in Real Racing**:
```
Only Scenario: Starter arms tree â†’ Auto-start system activates â†’ Auto-start handles everything
```

### Specific Code Areas Needing Terminology Updates

1. **Tree Status Fields** (`pkg/tree/tree.go`):
   - `ArmingSource` field terminology is incorrect
   - Should track "who decided to arm" not "who is in control"

2. **Auto-Start States** (`pkg/autostart/autostart.go`):
   - `StateArmed` should be `StateActivated` 
   - Auto-start doesn't get "armed", it gets "activated" when tree is armed

3. **Console Messages**:
   - Current: `"Auto-start system (three beams detected)"` 
   - Should be: `"Armed by three-beam rule"` (tree armed, auto-start activated)

4. **Method Names**:
   - `ArmAutomatically()` is misleading
   - Should be `ArmByThreeBeamRule()` or similar

### Auto-Start Timing Model Inconsistencies (Critical)

**Based on CompuLink documentation research, our auto-start model has several critical inaccuracies:**

1. **Missing 0.6-Second Stability Requirement**:
   - **Real System**: Requires three lights stable for 0.6 seconds before starting timeout
   - **Our System**: Immediately triggers on three beams detected
   - **Problem**: Allows manipulation via brief staging light flashes

2. **Incorrect Timeout Values**:
   - **Real System**: 7s (NHRA Pro), 10s (standard), 15s+ (bracket), track-configurable
   - **Our System**: Fixed 7s (pro) / 15s (sportsman)
   - **Problem**: Doesn't match real-world track variations

3. **Missing Dual Timer System**:
   - **Real System**: 30-second pre-stage timer + staging timeout
   - **Our System**: Single staging timeout only
   - **Problem**: Incomplete timeout coverage

4. **Incorrect Green Light Timing**:
   - **Real System**: 0.6-1.4 seconds after both cars staged for 0.6 seconds
   - **Our System**: Different random delay algorithm
   - **Problem**: Timing doesn't match professional standards

5. **Missing Automatic Red Light Penalty**:
   - **Real System**: Automatic red light for non-staging vehicle, non-negotiable
   - **Our System**: Generic "fault" state
   - **Problem**: Doesn't properly penalize timeout violations

6. **Incorrect Timer Start Logic**:
   - **Real System**: Both pre-staged + one staged + 0.6s stability = timer start
   - **Our System**: Immediate trigger on three beams
   - **Problem**: Vulnerable to staging manipulation tactics
